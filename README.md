## Project Description

Golden Souls is a third-person action RPG inspired by the Souls-like genre.  
Set in a dark fantasy world, players explore cursed dungeons, wield a variety of melee weapons, and battle monstrous enemies to survive.

This is a personal project I created to learn how to develop one of my favorite game genres.  
It was built using Unreal Engine 5 and C++, combining structured learning from a Udemy course with custom implementations such as a bow system and the UEnemySmartAttack component for advanced enemy behaviors.

## What I Learned

- Designed an open-world environment using Unreal Engine 5's Landscape and Foliage systems
- Built complex Animation Blueprints, retargeted animations, and used Control Rig with inverse kinematics for visual polish
- Built complex Animation Blueprints, retargeted animations, and used Control Rig with inverse kinematics for visual polish
- Developed melee combat systems with swords and other weapons, including Motion Warping for root motion animations
- Implemented health bars, player stats, and enemy AI with attack logic
- Created multiple enemy types, from humanoid warriors to monstrous creatures
- Applied best coding practices in C++, including use of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns
- Refactored codebase for clarity and maintainability, with strong emphasis on debugging and performance optimization
